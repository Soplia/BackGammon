### Tree Search Algorithm
#### 简介(Introduction)
1. We want to deal with a combinatorial 2-person positional game, and try to solve it through an Alpha/Beta Artificial Intelligence tree search procedure
    * Realizing a short bibliographical review on 2-person strategic games
    * Designing learning devices to be inserted into the tree search process
    * Designing the filtered tree search process
    * Implementing this procedure, and test its performance
